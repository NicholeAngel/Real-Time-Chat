## Setting up the Server

  

To use the real-time chat application, you need to first run server.py by opening a command prompt and navigating to the file location. Type the following command:

  


python  server.py


  

Alternatively, you can use any IDE of your choice.

  

## How to Use the Application

  

Use the same commands or visual Studio to run client.py to utilize the application. Keep in mind that for this to function correctly, the server must first be configured. Open `client.py}, then go to setup where your username needs to be entered. Following that, you'll be able to connect to the server and start chatting and having fun with other users!

  

client.py can be run in as many instances as desired.
